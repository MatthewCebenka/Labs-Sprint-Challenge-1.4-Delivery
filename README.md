- For Part Time Students: Please submit your work on this journal entry before the end of your B-Week Thursday class period.

## Template: Contribution Entry

Please respond to the following prompts to demonstrate your contributions to the delivery process and development cycle of your product.

Copy and paste these prompts into a `Google Doc`. Steps on how to create a google doc folder, and how this should look [can be found here](https://www.notion.so/lambdaschool/Labs-Journal-Entry-Submission-Logistics-a6003eb8288b4fd1af0fb40a1a42d278)

## Engineers and Data Scientists:

As a Web/iOS/DS student, break down your workflow during this unit. Describe your process and how you individually contributed to the team from planning to delivery.

Describe each phase and how you contributed to it as an engineer. **Please provide links or screenshots where you can.**

### Prompt 1

**Product vision document (PVD):** Explain what you contributed to the vision of the product and how you participated in the planning process. **Provide a screenshot/s of the portions of the PVD to which you contributed.**
I proposed the use of material ui for a refactoring of some unresponsive parts of the site. I always researched graphic mapping libraries and settled on the use of Ant L7. These were contributions to the technical spec.

### Prompt 2

**Release canvas/es:** Explain what you contributed to your release canvases. **Provide screenshots.**
I contributed to every card in the release canvas. My main focus was card two and four "Display Fixes and Social Media" and "Map Integration". I also presented card two during our group release canvas presentation to Parth. I also heavily focused on wording and grammar fixes to every release canvas card.
### Prompt 3

**Trello & task breakdown:** Describe your contributions to the task breakdown of your Trello board. **Screenshot Trello cards that you made.**
I have made atleast 4 or 5 trello cards. I have included pictures of bugs that I am working on or additions I am going to make to the UI. 

### Prompt 4

**Local environment:** Elaborate on your local environment set up. What problems came up during your local development environment set up? How did you overcome them? 
**Local environments for DS students could mean:** pipenv, virtualenv, docker, or k8 clusters. How have you utilized tools to ensure reproducibility when your product is deployed? How do packages and dependencies get loaded into your hosted environment?
I am using visual studio code with yarn for package management. I have not run into any problems with it so far. 

### Prompt 5

**Pull requests:** Show us a piece of your code that you're proud of. **Provide a link to a pull request that you're proud of.**
**For DS Students:** if you haven't made a pull request, provide a link to the commits you have made to the repo. If you have not been working on code directly, expand on what other aspects of the project you have focused on.

### Prompt 6

**Code reviews:** Describe your team's code-review process. How many reviewers reviewed your pull-request that was screen-shot above? **Link to a Pull-request that you personally reviewed.**
We always have atleast two reviewers. Someone will pull a branch down to their local environment and test to make sure the repo works there. We will then look over the code together and make sure everything makes sense.

### Prompt 7

**Quality assurance:** How did you test your product's features in a real-world environment? Describe the staging environment process for your team.
Other than testing it on a local server not much. Once the code is pushed to master it is automatically updating a automatic deploy which is hosted using aws. Once it is there we can look at the changes and make sure everything is as it should be.

### Prompt 8

**Release to production:** Describe how you shipped features to production. Who gave final approval? **Provide screenshots to the individual features you personally contributed to the project (could be front end or backend code, or screens you built for native mobile).**
I always run final changes by my PM and partner. We always review the changes together and test that the code runs on multiple machines before pushing to master. 


## UX Designers

For each of the following key events or deliverables, describe your contributions and provide relevant links or screenshots.

### Prompt 1

**Product vision document (PVD):** Explain your contribution to the product vision and your participation in the planning process. How did you brainstorm process(es) to solve the problem(s) in your PVD?

### Prompt 2

### Prompt 3

**Design ideation & exploration:** Describe how you iterated on each feature. What were the most challenging parts of the design process? How did you land on the current design direction(s)? How did usability testing and design critiques guide you?

### Prompt 4

**Design collaboration:** If you are working with another UX designer, how did you collaborate with each other?

### Prompt 5

**Design critiques:** Describe your learnings from one design critique session. What did you learn from the critique? How did you implement those learnings into your design work? How did you influence a different project's design direction?

### Prompt 6

**Design systems:** Describe the visual design choices for the product's design system. How did you decide on the color palette and type styles? How has using a design system changed your workflow? Explain how you delivered the design system guidelines to the team.

### Prompt 7

**Process reflection:** If you could start this project from scratch, what would you do differently? What have you learned from your Labs experience so far?
